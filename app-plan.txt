[HOME MANAGEMENT APP PLAN]

Purpose:
Build a full-stack app to manage house rent and daily meal cost sharing among members,
using Angular (frontend), Express (backend), and MongoDB (database), all served locally with global access via ngrok.

Features Overview:

1. House Member Management:
   - Add/Edit/Delete members
   - Assign each member to a room

2. House Setup:
   - Define rooms (e.g., Room A, Room B)
   - Set rent percentage per room (e.g., Room A = 60%, Room B = 40%)
   - Divide total house rent accordingly
   - If multiple people in a room, rent is shared equally within that room

3. Meal Wallet & Costing:
   - Members can add money to their meal wallet (wallet history saved)
   - Admin inputs daily bazar cost (date, description, amount)
   - Admin inputs how many meals each person ate per day
   - Calculate total meals, meal rate (total bazar cost / total meals)
   - Deduct cost from each memberâ€™s wallet based on meals eaten

4. Reporting:
   - Show current wallet balance of each member
   - Monthly or daily meal report
   - House rent report per person

5. Data Access & Hosting:
   - Backend (Express + MongoDB) runs on local PC (port 5000)
   - Frontend (Angular) runs on local PC (port 4200)
   - ngrok used to expose frontend globally for remote access

Optional Features (Later):
   - Authentication (password-based or PIN for admin access)
   - PDF report generation
   - Monthly data archiving or reset
   - Export/Import system data as JSON for backup

Tools & Technologies:
- Frontend: Angular + Angular Material + ngx-charts (optional)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB (local instance)
- Communication: REST API (JSON)
- Exposure: ngrok (for public URL)
